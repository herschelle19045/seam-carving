### Description:

This project implements the seam carving algorithm for content-aware image resizing. Seam carving removes seams (single pixels) from an image to change its dimensions while preserving its visual integrity. This technique is particularly useful for resizing images without distorting important details.

### Technologies Used:

  * **Programming Language:** C++
  * **Image Processing Library:** OpenCV

### Installation:

**OpenCV Setup:**

This project uses OpenCV for image processing functionalities. There are several ways to install OpenCV in Visual Studio. Here's a helpful video tutorial that guides you through the process:

### Usage:

1.  **Prepare your images:** Place the images you want to resize in the same directory as your code file (where the application is compiled and run).

2.  **Run the application:**
    Compile and run your code according to your Visual Studio setup.

3.  **View the results:** The resized images will be saved in the same directory as your code file, with appropriate naming conventions (e.g., resized\_image.jpg).

### Algorithm Overview:

The seam carving algorithm involves the following steps:

1.  **Energy Calculation:** Calculate the energy of each pixel in the image using an energy function (e.g., gradients).
2.  **Seam Marking:** Find the seam with the minimum cumulative energy from top to bottom.
3.  **Seam Removal:** Remove the marked seam to reduce or increase the image size.
4.  **Iteration:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the desired dimensions are reached.
